### Official Hosted Version Limitations

The official hosted version of tech informal is hosted on a low-cost server with limited resources. Therefore, it has some limitations:

- Channel Creation: Users can create iff they are allowed by the owner.
- Post Creation: Users can create posts iff they are allowed by the owner.

Note that any of the limitations are because of the limited resources of the server, there is no political or related incentive behind these limitations.

Once this project becomes stable the proper `Self-Hosted` documentation will be released which will have no limitations.

However, for monetary reasons the official hosted version of this project will have some advertisements and limitations. But the self-hosted version will have no advertisements and limitations.
